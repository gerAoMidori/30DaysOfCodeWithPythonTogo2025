# 🚀 30 Days of Python Challenge – Python Togo 🇹🇬

Welcome to my journey through the **#30DaysOfCodeWithPythonTogo** challenge organized by [Python Togo](https://pytogo.org)!  
This repository contains all my daily solutions and notes as I progress through the challenge.

## 📅 My Progress

I started the challenge on **Day 9 – Conditionals**, and I’m continuing daily from there.

Each folder in this repository represents one day of the challenge, with Python code focused on that day's topic.

> ✅ The goal is to build consistency, deepen understanding, and improve practical coding skills — one day at a time.
